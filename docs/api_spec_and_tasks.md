## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point for the application. Initializes Flask app and routes."),
    ("wallet.py", "Contains the Wallet class. Responsible for key generation, saving and loading keys."),
    ("transaction.py", "Contains the Transaction class. Responsible for creating transactions."),
    ("blockchain.py", "Contains the Blockchain class. Responsible for adding transactions and mining blocks."),
    ("database.py", "Contains the Database class. Responsible for creating tables, inserting and retrieving wallets.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "wallet.py",
    "transaction.py",
    "blockchain.py",
    "database.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'wallet.py' contains the Wallet class which is responsible for generating, saving and loading keys.
'transaction.py' contains the Transaction class which is responsible for creating transactions.
'blockchain.py' contains the Blockchain class which is responsible for adding transactions and mining blocks.
'database.py' contains the Database class which is responsible for creating tables, inserting and retrieving wallets.
'main.py' is the main entry point for the application. It initializes the Flask app and routes.

```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. However, it should be noted that creating a secure Bitcoin wallet is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of cryptography and blockchain technology. The above design is a simplified version and should not be used for storing real Bitcoin. Also, we need to ensure that all third-party libraries are initialized properly.
